/*
A sum of scalar multiples of several columns is called a linear combination of these columns. For
example, sx + ty is a linear combination of x and y for any choice of numbers s and t.

            Advances seq by calling seq.popFront until either find!(pred)(choices, seq.front)

            Parameters
            Name	Description
            pred	The predicate to use for determining a match.
            seq	The input range to search.
            choices	A forward range of possible choices.
            Returns

            seq advanced to the first matching element, or until empty if there are no matching elements.
